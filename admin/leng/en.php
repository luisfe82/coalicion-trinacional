'cdefendemos1'=>'We represent education personnel members of the unions of Mexico the United States and Canada who are linked to the Trinational Coalition for the Defense of Public Education. We coordinate the activities of defending public education against the effects of privatization and insufficient state funding which have been accentuated by the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 and during the economic crisis of 2008 after which governments applied budgetary restrictions to the education system. We believe that adequate and equitable financing of public education is a responsibility of States and should not be subject to the risks of the economic situation.',
'cdefendemos2'=>'Affirm that basic training vocational or technical training and higher education should take into account issues of food security sustainable agriculture sustainable energy development and environmental protection as well as issues relating to human rights democracy intercultural relations responsible consumption and fair trade  with the prospect of a viable future.',
'cdefendemos3'=>'We believe that it is absolutely necessary to ensure adequate and equitable funding for public education. The current system that favours a private school accessible to the wealthiest classes must be put to an end at the expense of an underfunded public school.',
'cdefendemos4'=>'We see from our experience and collective reflection that neither national education policies nor investments are up to the challenges in a world where broader access to education is more necessary than ever.',
'cdefendemos5'=>'We are convinced that this deplorable trend must be reversed. This requires collective action. We affirm that our education systems need major democratic transformations. We will continue through our organizations to work tirelessly and in solidarity so that changes are made that respond to the needs and well-being of the people.',
'cdefendemos6'=>'We affirm that education is a fundamental universal social right that includes not only general training but also vocational or technical training. This right must be ensured by a public service under the responsibility of the State and financed by the latter. Consequently we will fight in solidarity the trade and elitist policies that govern in many parts of North America and that lead to an increase in the privatization of education.',
'cdefendemos7'=>'Education is not a commodity that serves to enrich companies. Students are not products. Parents of students and students are not consumers or customers of education. Education staff members are not just service providers. We are strongly opposed to education being included in any agreement on the liberalization of trade in services. We oppose the commercialization of education and all public services the use in education of a commercial discourse and the will to impose as a parameter the cost/benefit ratio.',
'cdefendemos8'=>'We proclaim that a comprehensive and accessible education must form free and critical people active and committed citizens respectful of diversity and human rights open to the world concerned about the future of the planet and its lasting development and who have obtained a critical understanding of globalization. That it should train women and men who will be prepared for life the world of work and continuous learning rather than being closely trained in view of a particular job.',
'cdefendemos9'=>'We defend an accessible education which is an instrument of social justice and emancipation of people throughout their lives. That it promises equality between women and men whatever their ethnic origins their sexual orientations their beliefs or philosophical choices and their learning abilities. It forms human beings who will prefer collaboration and solidarity to unlimited competition who will seek peace the just and peaceful resolution of conflicts and who will oppose violence and militarization.',
'cdefendemos10'=>'We strive for a free public education that is fully accessible to all levels of education and throughout life. We are convinced that compulsory basic education for all both young and old should enable them to achieve a minimum of eleven years of schooling. We reject the proverb that the success of a large number is synonymous with mediocrity. We affirm on the contrary that one could not achieve quality education without democratization without the elimination of inequalities.',
'cdefendemos11'=>'We support a vision of adult education that guarantees the right to public education for the entire adult population. In addition we urge governments to create the conditions for a culture of lifelong education multiplying opportunities for learning in livelihoods and workplaces.',
'cdefendemos12'=>'We oppose a narrowly defined conception of quality based on standardized tests and other similar measures that have the effect of reducing the mission of education to what can be easily measured and that does not take into account the special needs of students. We demand the withdrawal of those exams that are used as instruments of exclusion.',
'cdefendemos13'=>'Our purpose is to combat racism exclusion and marginalization which affect linguistic religious and cultural minorities especially students from black indigenous and Latin American communities. We affirm that students with disabilities or with difficulties in adaptation or learning street children workers or itinerant children should have access to special services that ensure their schooling. Finally we demand that special attention be paid to rural education and respect for peasant culture.',
'cdefendemos14'=>'We intend to continue contributing to the development of models and pedagogical approaches that respond to the social economic and cultural needs of our peoples which aspire to reduce failures dropout and school exclusion. We promote a democratic management of education at all levels of education and in all institutions based on the participation of staff students and the community.',
'cdefendemos15'=>'We recognize the importance of the services that come to support educational action in the school environment as well as the educational contribution of other institutions (public libraries radio stations and educational television channels). We recognize the contribution and appreciation of the participants of the means of popular education and community action.',
'cdefendemos16'=>'We affirm the need for accessible free and quality higher public education which respects academic freedom academic freedom and the institutional autonomy of universities and ensures that research is at the service of the development of society and that it is not subject to the needs and requirements of private companies.',
'cdefendemos17'=>'We believe in a secular education respectful of religious and philosophical beliefs the right to secularization freedom of conscience and equality.',
'cdefendemos18'=>'We support the struggle of indigenous nations and indigenous peoples who demand control of their educational institutions in order to ensure respect for and promotion of their languages cultures and heritage and for an education that values and disseminates ethnic diversity as well as cultural and linguistic plurality. Public education must integrate the history and culture of these peoples and staff must be trained in that regard.',
'cdefendemos19'=>'We recognize the importance for national minority language communities of exercising control over their educational institutions in order to ensure the dissemination and promotion of their language and culture.',
'cdefendemos20'=>'We denounce the situation of inequality experienced by women who make up the vast majority of education personnel. They should receive adequate maternity protection benefits. We are also committed to combating all forms of employment-related discrimination.',
'cdefendemos21'=>'We affirm that the changes necessary for democratic education require a solid initial training of education personnel as well as free continuing training accessible to all. <br> Finally we reaffirm with conviction that education is a right not a privilege. The democracy to which we aspire is made up of equality freedom for all and solidarity. It is based on the dignity of the person on good living conditions on respect for the political economic cultural environmental and social rights of all.',
'cdefendemos22'=>'We recognize the importance of the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for educational purposes that respond to the needs and priorities identified by the community and not by commercial interests. We favour in particular the creation of a network with the purpose of sharing knowledge and spreading a culture of collaborative work. We draw attention to the risks associated with a restricted use of ICTs and to practices that seek to circumvent national sovereignty in education. We are thus opposed to the use of virtual and distance education as a substitute for direct and quality education.',
